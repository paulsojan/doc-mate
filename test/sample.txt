Begin by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Prepare four boneless, skinless chicken breasts by cutting a pocket into the side of each breast, being careful not to cut all the way through. Season the chicken with salt and pepper to taste. In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter over medium heat. Add 1 small diced onion and 2 minced garlic cloves, and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add 8 ounces of fresh spinach and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat and let the mixture cool slightly,
In a bowl, combine the spinach mixture with 4 ounces of softened cream cheese, 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Mix until well combined. Stuff each chicken breast pocket with an equal amount of the spinach mixture. Seal the pocket with a toothpick if necessary. In the same skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the stuffed chicken breasts and sear on each side for 3-4 minutes, or until golden brown.
